H2 Dashboard â€” Design A (KPI Grid) for Solar-Hydrogen System
Files in this ZIP:
- H2app.py                  : Streamlit app (main). Run with `streamlit run H2app.py`
- designA_hydrogen_dashboard.py : Backup copy of the same Streamlit app.
- design_preview.png        : Mockup PNG image of Design A dashboard.
- readme.txt                : This file.

Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- Install dependencies:
    pip install streamlit pandas plotly numpy pillow

Run:
1) unzip the files or run directly in the folder
2) launch the app:
    streamlit run H2app.py
3) Use the sidebar to edit constants and upload a monthly CSV named with columns:
    month, solar_kwh, demand_kwh
   (12 rows for Jan-Dec).

Notes:
- The app uses default values from your research paper (electrolyzer efficiency, solar, H2 production profile).
- To use your paper equations precisely, open H2app.py and replace the computation blocks marked in the code comments.
- The design_preview.png is a static mockup. The interactive dashboard generated by Streamlit will match the Design A layout and colors.
